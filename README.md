# KNN-Implementaion

1st homework assignment in intro ML and data science course - implementation of KNN classifier.

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
It classifies a data point based on the majority label of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.
The "K" in KNN refers to the number of neighbors considered, which is a user-defined parameter.

In this homework assignment, I was asked to implement a KNN classifier based on the Iris flower data.

I was provided with 3 completed functions - the data split function, the plot function and the main function.
The steps given in the main function are calls for functions (Load data -> Split data -> Classify -> Calculate accuracy -> Plot).
The data split was done using student IDs. In the code provided here I used random numbers in the same range (9-digit number).

I was required to complete 6 functions: Load data, Distance Calculation, Sort Array, Majority Vote, KNNClassifier and Accuracy calculation.
